# Tournament Manager

Tournament Manager is a Next.JS that allows users to create and manage tournaments.
It currently supports creating single-elimination brackets.
It is built with Next.JS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Drizzle, OpenAuth, and Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Currently, generating single-elim brackets with an odd number of players (byes) is a bit buggy.
